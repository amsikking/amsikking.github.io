			2023: Dynamic remote refocus microscope, WO2024086322A1</a>
			</dt>
			<dd>
			Remote refocus microscope systems are disclosed. The system includes a first microscope 
			arranged to receive light from the sample in a medium having a sample refractive index ns 
			with a first objective lens having a first numerical aperture NAi and a first immersion 
			medium with a first refractive index m, a second microscope including a second objective 
			lens having a second numerical aperture NA2 and a second refractive index U2, and an 
			optical compensator disposed between the first microscope and the second microscope, the 
			optical compensator comprising at least one lens having a linearly adjustable position to 
			provide for MRR to be continuously tuned to approximately equal to a ratio of (ns/n2). The 
			system is modular where the first objective can be changed to permit operation in one of 
			three modes. Methods for configuring a remote refocus microscope into one of three modes 
			are also disclosed.
